# cephr

This is a Library-Driven cookbook for installing and managing [Ceph](http://ceph.com/) clusters.

It is written to be generic so that it can be consumed by anyone wishing to make installing and managing a Ceph cluster easier.  It is opinionated where in the what, but not the how or where.  Want to store your secrets in node attributes?  Great!  Want to use an encrypted data_bag?  That's good with me!  Want to use a secret management tool like [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)?  Sweet!  Who am I to get in your way?
